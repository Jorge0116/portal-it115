       <p>Hello, I am a Software Development student at Seattle Central Community College.  In my experience of working in agriculture, I have seen the need of better farming equipment. I have worked in the agricultural world since I was 10 years old. Every summer I would go work in the vineyards or apple field to make money for school cloths and sports equipment. When I was not at practice I was working in the fields. <br>
      I have worked harvesting of up to 10 or more varieties of apples, pears, cherries, wheat, beans, and even monitored the watering system for 2800 acres of these and other crops. Learning how to do quick fixes to finish the day and then coming back and repairing. I was also a mechanic's assistant at the farm helping the mechanic change clutches, transmissions, and perform normal services to tractors and trucks. <br>  
With both my previous work experience and educational track, I hope to help build technology that will assist in productivity and make agriculture a safer world to work in. As an aspiring software developer in the Year Up Program I am learning new technical skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the base languages for programming and building software. I want to put both my experience in farming and software development together to better the farm equipment industry; to make better days of work with better ways to work.
